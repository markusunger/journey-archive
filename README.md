# Journey Entry Viewer

A completely over-engineered application to view entries from the Journey app.

## Setup

1. Grab exported Journey archive and make available under `assets/` (raw JSON files and images)
2. Create `.env` file (copy `.env.example` and update variables)
3. `docker-compose up --build`
4. In the browser, enter the hostname or IP of the system where `docker-compose` is running :smiley:
